# p4sstime SourceMod Plugin

The plugin source code can be found under `scripting/`.

This plugin is licensed under the GNU GPL 3.0.

# For server hosts

This plugin was most recently tested on Metamod:Source version 1.11.0 and SourceMod version 1.11.0.6964. Make sure your server is running this version or higher for best results.

In the [releases section](https://github.com/prplnorangesoda/p4sstime-plugin/releases), you can find the .smx file associated with each release. You can insert it into `[YOURSERVERDIRECTORY]/tf/addons/sourcemod/plugins/` and it will be loaded on your SourceMod server.

## Features

This plugin is not meant to be very in-your-face featureful - just a utility for simple things that TF2 should have / fix
(like medic arrows splashing the ball, banning default hitscan weapons). It also includes printing events to chat. If
it's not strictly necessary, doesn't patch a base game bug, or isn't helpful it might not be a good fit for this
plugin.

## Issues

If you have any suggestions, please file an Issue in the Issues tab. 
Any critical bugs should be filed as soon as you know about them. 

If it is truly game-breaking / security vulnerable, message a developer in
the official PASS Time Discord and we can sort it out.

## Setting up development environment

To work on this plugin, here are the steps:

### Setting up a TF2 server

Firstly, you must set up a TF2 server in order to run the plugin. This can be hosted on your local computer through `sv_lan 1`.

1. Setting up the server:

   - Guide for Windows: https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Windows_dedicated_server
   - Guide for Linux: https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Linux_dedicated_server

2. Installing MetaMod:Source and SourceMod on the server (follow the "dedicated server" instructions): https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Installing_SourceMod_(simple)

### Working on the plugin

1. Clone the contents of the repository to the `[server]/tf/addons/sourcemod` folder.

_Note: the process from here divulges from Windows and Linux development. I personally use Mint Linux, so this guide will be written from the perspective of a similar machine._

#### Linux

2.  The compile shell script in `scripting/compile.sh` will compile all .sp files listed in `scripting/` to `plugins/`. With SourceMod, there should come an executable named `spcomp`, which will compile the plugin for you.

    - _Note: If you open this repository using VSCode, there is a "compile all plugins" task that will run this script for you._
    - Here's expected output:

    ```
     $ ./scripting/compile.sh

    	Compiling p4sstime.sp ...

    	Stack/heap size: 18516 bytes
    	Total requirements: 97780 bytes

    	1 Warning.
    ```

    I've fixed the warning above, but it's left in as an example.

#### Windows

I don't have any guidance here for how to compile on Windows yet, sorry. It's compiled like a normal SourceMod plugin with includes.

---

From there on you should be set to modify the .sp files, compile the plugin, and run your SourceMod server. To hot-reload the plugin with new changes, run `sm plugins reload p4sstime` serverside (or `rcon sm plugins reload p4sstime` through rcon), and see your changes!

Note: this plugin has a _really_ strict `.gitignore`. If you add a new file outside of the `scripting/p4sstime/` folder, chances are it may not be picked up. Remember to include your new file in the `.gitignore`.
